# typobuster
Work in progress: a simple text editor designed to automatically fix common typos.

In my work with Wordpress, I receive texts in various formats (MS Word, LibreOffice, email) every day, which constantly 
contain the same errors: misplaced spaces, multiple spaces and line breaks, German-style quotation marks, etc. 
Up until now, I have used Mousepad to proofread, either manually or via search and replace, but that was kind of 
a waste of time. To make life easier, I'm writing a simple editor based on gtksourceview4, that will do it automatically. 
Besides, it is supposed to contain only the basic tools that I actually use in my work, such as changing the case of 
characters, and nothing more.
