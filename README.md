# Typobuster
Simplified text editor with a wide selection of transformations and automatic correction of common typos.

In my daily work I constantly receive texts in various formats (MS Word, LibreOffice, email), which are supposed to be published
on the web and contain still the same typos: misplaced spaces, multiple spaces and line breaks, German-style quotation marks, etc. 
Up until now, I have used Mousepad to proofread, either manually or via search and replace, but that was kind of 
waste of time. To make life easier, I developed a simple editor based on that will do it automatically. It is supposed to contain 
only the basic tools that I actually need in my work (mostly various text transformations), and case-insensitive sorting.
